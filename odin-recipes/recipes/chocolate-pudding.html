    Easy-to-make homemade chocolate pudding.

    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups whole milk, divided</li>
      <li>¼ cup cornstarch</li>
      <li>⅓ cup white sugar, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine 1/2 cup milk and cornstarch in a small bowl. Whisk or stir with
        a fork until smooth and all lumps have been incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine remaining milk with sugar in a medium saucepan over low heat.
        Slowly whisk in the cornstarch mixture. Cook, whisking as needed to
        prevent lumps from forming, until mixture begins to thicken, 8 to 10
        minutes. Add chocolate chips and salt. Continue stirring until chips are
        completely melted and pudding is smooth and thickened, about 7 minutes
        more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour pudding into 1 large bowl or 6 individual bowls. Place plastic wrap
        directly on top of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming; smooth it
        gently against the surface. Refrigerate for at least 3 to 4 hours before
        serving.
